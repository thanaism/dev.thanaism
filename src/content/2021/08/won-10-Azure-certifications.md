## I've won 10 Azure certifications!

Hi there, I'm Thanai. Japanese version of this article [here](https://techblog.ap-com.co.jp/entry/2021/08/18/215844).

In the past, I wrote an article titled ["Let's Dive into the Azure World Quickly with Microsoft Learn!"][1] (in Japanese).

[1]: https://techblog.ap-com.co.jp/entry/2021/03/05/161446

It's been about five months since then, and I've been working on Microsoft Learn steadily during that time.

And before I knew it, I had 10 Azure MCP exams under my belt.

## My challenge to Azure certification started this year

Actually, I started to challenge Azure exams only after this year started, and the qualifications and timing are listed below.

- AZ-900: Jan 4
- AZ-104: Feb 13
- AZ-400: Feb 22
- AZ-303: Mar 8
- AZ-304: Mar 9
- AI-900: Mar 25
- AZ-500: Apr 2
- AZ-204: Apr 9

(3 months to the day)

- DP-900: Jul 2
- DP-100: Jul 9
- AZ-600: Aug 12

In the middle of the project, there is a period of time when there is clearly no motivation, but at that time, the AZ-600 had just been released in beta version. So I were going to end it there since we had finished the main AZ series.

But then I had a free voucher for the DP-900 and DP-100.

Just as the deadline was about to expire, I received a comment from a team member, "Oh, you're going to win the whole thing, aren't you? Of course, this was said in jest, "Yes!" I shouted in my mind.

I also announced to the team Slack that I would win all the prizes by the end of the year (silly me).

## The question is whether it's 10 or 11.

Did any of you notice that there are 11 items in the above list, although I said 10?
That's right, as far as the number of "exams" passed, it's 11.

However, AZ-303 and 304 are crooked because you have to pass two exams to get one certification.
As a result, the number of Azure "certifications" is 10.

By the way, with AWS, you need to pass 12 exams to get the full certification.

With Azure, the number of exams is unnecessarily large, and with the recent addition of the AZ-700 beta, it's a tough road to finally get the full crown with **19 exams !!!!!!**

But fortunately, the company paid for all the exam fees, so I didn't have to worry about my financial situation.

(There are some Microsoft events like AZ-900 where you can get free vouchers!

## Tips for Azure Exam

I've been taking them at a rate of roughly one every two weeks, excluding periods of inactivity.

I can't write in detail about the content of the exams due to the terms and conditions, but I have taken a few and found that there are some obvious maxims for passing.

I can assure you that if you do this, your chances of passing the exam will increase dramatically.

That's right, ......!

**It means to book the exam.**

You may think that this is an obvious thing to do, but I am rather serious.

If you want to pass the exam in two weeks, you have to book it in two weeks.

Because the exam can be taken at any time, it's easy to say, "Oh, maybe I won't have time to study, so I'll just take it a month later."

If you extend the exam date by one week, you will only have one more week of not studying.

In fact, I didn't do anything during the 3 month gap.
