# GitHub Push To Post Article Test

This is my first time to edit article on vscode and push to post it.

## Set custom domain and SSL

`SSL` is an abbreviation for `Secure Sockets Layer`.  
To use cumston domain on Netlify, I went to my ConoHa setting board and set provided CNAME setting.

## Using img test
